                <h3>Edge of Tomorrow</h3>
                    <p>This is my favorite movie because I loved the origonal light novel. It was based on. </p>
                
                <h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
                    <p>This childhood cartoon stood out to me because of sacrifice the giant made at the end. To prove he was more than just a weapon.</p>
                
                <h3>Scott Pilgrim Versus the World</h3>
                    <p>This movie was just so much fun that I can't help but to smile when I see clips of it time to time.
